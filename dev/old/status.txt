  locateLink function firing off gathering necessary/required environment details/variables for tracking link's character during game play
  locateLink function tied to output console HTML for viewing in browser without having to look @ console.log
  
2018-04-11
link-dev-02.js, link-dev-02.html - locateLink function almost complete, awaiting walkability scoring

2018-04-11
link-dev-02.js, link-dev-02.html - walkability implemented, keyboard events implemented
link-dev-02b.js, link-dev-02b.html - walkability implemented, keyboard events implemented and separated into own script

2018-04-11
link-dev-03.js, link-dev-03.html - need to implement movement functionality.

2018-04-12
link-dev-03b.js, link-dev-03b.html - move north functionality almost implemented. need to handle offgrid options, and a few other things. implementing other three directions this release.

2018-04-12
link-dev-03c.js, link-dev-03c.html - all four movement options implemented with more functionality.
	- need to handle offgrid screen options
	- need to handle half height of the last row in each current active screen: going south normally, going north via current active screen grid to offscreen grid north option
	- collision detection is working! @ least on the origin tile, and off course not handling the two exceptions listed above...
	
2018-04-12
link-dev-03d.js, link-dev-03d.html - movement and animation classes for link green implemented for north, east, south, and west movement actions
	- need to handle offgrid screen options
	- need to handle half height of the last row in each current active screen: going south normally, going north via current active screen grid to offscreen grid north option

	
2018-04-13
link-dev-03e.js, link-dev-03e.html
	- implement offgrid screen functionality; function/outline is there!!!!!
	- test doubly on south movement because this specifically wasn't looked @ because origin tile has no south option/too lazy to put in another tile...
	- need to handle half height of the last row in each current active screen: going south normally, going north via current active screen grid to offscreen grid north option
	
	
2018-04-13
link-dev-03ea.js, link-dev-03ea.html - offscreen grid movement option functionality implemented!
	- implement offgrid screen functionality for east, south, and west directional movements.
	- test doubly on south movement because this specifically wasn't looked @ because origin file has no south option/too lazy to put in another tile...
	- need to handle half height of the last row in each current active screen: going south normally...
	- need to update hyrule grid map locator in subscreen upon tile change!
	- update link's character for each movement too!
	
	
2018-04-13
link-dev-03eb.js, link-dev-03eb.html - offscreen grid tile movement move action now updating variables properly. testing going from origin tile, north to tile 0708.
	- implement offgrid screen functionality for east, south, and west directional movements.
	- test doubly on south movement because this specifically wasn't looked @ because origin file has no south option/too lazy to put in another tile...
	- need to handle half height of the last row in each current active screen: going south normally...
	- need to update hyrule grid map locator in subscreen upon tile change!
	- update link's character for each movement too!

2018-04-14
link-dev-03ec.js, link-dev-03ec.html - south off screen movement option functionality implemented, @ least in all rows save the last; need to test on last row - south off screen grid option...there should be no option/no functionality!!!!
	- implement offgrid screen functionality for east, and west directional movements.
	- test implementation of off screen movement options in new active screen grids that link has moved into...noticed east/west movement options are broken after going from tile 0808 (origin) to 0708; going east/west from 0708 is broken, whereas east/west in 0808 is not. 0808 is not broken because the functionality option isn't there...yet. I think...
	- need to handle half height of last row in each current active screen: going south normally....
	- need to update hyrule grid map locator in subscreen upon tile change!
	- update link's character for each movement too!
	
	
	
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW/WHAT TO DO ABOUT OFF SCREEN GRIDS.....
	- generate them after finding out possible movement options for the first time in/on current active screen grid.
	- delete/destroy existing off screen grids after one has been moved into.
	- generate off screen grids for current active screen grid, upon deleting/destroying off screen grids unused/left over from latest current active tile change....
	

2018-04-15
link-dev-03ed.js link-dev-03ed.html - east off screen grid functionality implemented.
	- need to update hyrule grid map locator in subscreen upon tile change!
	- ensure updateLink()/locateLink() are firing off at proper times across the board.
	- check last status update before this (last update for 2018-04-14 -> link-dev-03ec.js and link-dev-03ec.html) issues and ensure they are implemented across the board!
	

2018-04-18
link-dev-03ef.js, link-dev-03ef.html - new functionality!!! lots of missing old functionality!!!!
	- swapped tile generation functionality for ajax calls and proper json responses.
	- currently only functional moving north from the origin tile
		- on that note, its the only option implemented on, so just port the functionality down the chain and it should all be coming together!!!!!

		
2018-04-18
link-dev-03eg.js, link-dev-03eg.html - movement option tiles functionality complete for all directions from origin tile!
	- NEED: to correct link classes entering new tiles; example: coming south from 0708 to 0808, link is still facing north after entering the new tile
	
2018-04-19
link-dev-03eh.js, link-dev-03eh.html - movement across hyrule almost functional
- need to fix tiles current set to unwalkable: ladders/bridges whatever they are called. also black tiles (doors)
- fix position of link when changing directions
- fix wrong styles on background tiles
- tie hyrule overworld map in subscreen to link's movements; make it dynamic
- look up enemies movements

2018-04-19 - cleaned up a few things
link-dev-03eh.js and link-dev-03eh.html not touched; dont as link-dev.js, and link-dev.html. saving as link-dev-03eh.js and link-dev-03eh.html and moving onto "ei" for development
- need to fix tiles current set to unwalkable: ladders/bridges whatever they are called. also black tiles (doors)
- fix position of link when changing directions
- fix wrong styles on background tiles
- tie hyrule overworld map in subscreen to link's movements; make it dynamic

	link cannot advance to the bottom row of the screen grid, preventing him from access the southern tile option.
